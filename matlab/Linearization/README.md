# ct_dsge/Linearization

This folder is part of the replication package for the paper:

**"Estimation of continuous-time linear DSGE models from discrete-time measurements"**  
*B.J. Christensen, L. Neri, and J.C. Parra-Alvarez*

## Overview

The `Linearization` folder contains 

1. [AutoDiff/](AutoDiff/) – Folder containing the package for *automatic differentiation* used in the model solution
2. [phact/](phact/) –  Folder containing a toolbox for solving heterogeneous agent models as described in *Ahn, SeHyoun, et al. “When Inequality Matters for Macro and Macro Matters for Inequality.” NBER Macroeconomics Annual 2017, volume 32. University of Chicago Press, 2017.*
