# ct_dsge/model_loglin 

This folder is part of the replication package for the paper: **"Estimation of continuous-time linear DSGE models from discrete-time measurements"** by *B.J. Christensen, L. Neri, and J.C. Parra-Alvarez*

## Overview

The **model_loglin** folder contains 

1. [`equilibrium_conditions_loglin.m`](equilibrium_conditions_loglin.m) – The log-linearized equilibrium conditions of the continuous-time DSGE model
2. [`paramstructbase.m`](paramstructbase.m) – A file with the calibrated parameter values used in the model solution
3. [`model_solution_loglin.m`](model_solution_loglin.m) – Scripts that solve the DSGE model described in the paper
